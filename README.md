### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Michael. Here you can find all of my projects or the ones I have contribute. Most of them made for practicing in specific technologies, design patterns, and best practices of web development.

-   :microscope: Iâ€™m currently working at [Orfium](https://www.orfium.com/). I am mainly focused on handling cutting-edge front-end web technologies with also a strong understanding of back-end technologies.
-   :books: I love reading books about principles of object-oriented programming like SOLID and software design philosophies like Clean Architecture.
